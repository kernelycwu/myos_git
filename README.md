The code is ugly. It is rather dirty, but it works. 

Supported  Features

I created a Unix-like toy operating system based on my learning objectives.

1. I created a basic kernel with the following kernel features。
bootloader 、Memory Management、process 、Interrupts 、Filesystem Support 、Keyboard 

2. I expanded my operating system into user-space and add support for programs
System Calls 、Fork and Execute 、 Shell


3. With above basic features, I writed other features.
 x86_64 、VMX 、 Symmetric Multiprocessing


4. My operating systems don't operate in the basic gui mode, I'll write graphics drivers.

Compilation

You can build the kernel by make. After compilation is done, an image file  called xxx.img   will be generated by makediskimg.

Running

After you have finished compiling the operating system, you can run the following command to launch it in the qemu emulator:
make qemu

Makefile Options

make clean - Removes all intermediate and final build output
