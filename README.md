The code is ugly. It is rather dirty, but it works.
I created a Unix-like toy operating system based on my learning objectives.

1.I created a basic kernel with the following kernel featuresã€‚
bootloader
process
Memory Management
Interrupts
Filesystem Support
Keyboard 

2.I expanded my operating system into user-space and add support for programs
Fork and Execute
Shell
System Calls

3. With above basic features, I writed other features.
Symmetric Multiprocessing
VMX
x86_64

4. My operating systems don't operate in the basic gui mode, I'll write graphics drivers.
